# Information-Retrieval-System

CSC 575 SEARCH RETRIEVAL SYSTEM - FINAL PROJECT

The main function of the system contains everything required to run the program. To start the system, we have to open the jupyter notebook file ‘Search Retrieval System.ipynb’ and run all the cells and the last cell that calls the main() function will start the system and open a window where the query can be entered. The inverted index and doc lengths json files need to be in the same directory as the system code and if not, the program creates a new inverted index and doc lengths dictionary before running the program. The required data for testing the system (MED.ALL file - has all the documents with document id) also needs to be in the same directory as the system. The other files MED.QRY and MEL.REL is only required if the evaluation functions of the system are run.
